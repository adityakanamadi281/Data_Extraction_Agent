# Consent-First PII Extraction Agent

> **IMPORTANT:** This project is intended **only** for extracting personally-identifiable information (PII) — e.g., name, email, phone — from datasets where *every record is accompanied by explicit documented consent for this extraction and processing*. This repository **must not** be used to harvest credentials (passwords), scrape private profiles without permission, or to deanonymize individuals. Any attempt to use this project for non-consensual data collection is strictly prohibited.

## Overview

The Consent-First PII Extraction Agent is a small, auditable pipeline that:
- ingests datasets that are accompanied by valid consent metadata,
- extracts specific, minimal fields (name, email, phone),
- validates and normalizes those fields,
- stores the results securely (encrypted at rest),
- logs operations for audit purposes.

## Key Principles

1. **Consent Required** — Every input record **must** include a consent token or explicit consent metadata detailing scope, date/time, and origin. Extraction without explicit consent is forbidden.
2. **Minimal Data** — Only extract fields explicitly required (name, email, phone). Do **not** extract passwords, authentication tokens, or other sensitive secrets.
3. **Purpose Limitation** — Clearly document purpose and retain data only as long as required.
4. **Security by Design** — Encryption at rest and in transit, access controls, and audit logging.
5. **Privacy-preserving** — Provide options to anonymize, pseudonymize, or hash sensitive fields if downstream usage doesn't require raw values.
6. **Compliance** — Follow applicable laws and policies (GDPR, CCPA, internal policies). Maintain a data processing register.
